# Introduction
This code book provides an overview of data fields in  tidydata.txt

Identifiers
===========
- subject  - The ID of the test subject
- activity  - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

Measurements
============
Values between -1 and 1 representing a variety of recorded data. Means of repeated data were taken (ie where subject and test were both the same over multiple rows). No other numerical manipulation took place.
